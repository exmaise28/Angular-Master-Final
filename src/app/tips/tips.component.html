                <h4>High Waters</h4>
                <p>
                  Flooded trees, Flooded Run-out areas, and Tributaries are often the greatest fishing areas to try. Depending 
                  on what you are fishing for these areas typically hold the volume of fish species.

                <h4>Low Waters</h4>
                <p>
                  Depending on the time of the year during low waters, the water temperature can play a huge part in what you are searching for.
                  Running streams and highly oxygenated waters often hold bass and related species. Deep waters will hold catfish.

                <h4>Steady Waters</h4>
                <p>
                  Possibly the fishermans dream when fishing for multiple days, the fish will tend to their natural habitat and often be easier to catch during these periods.

                <h4>Fluctuating Waters</h4>
                <p>
                  During a fast rise or fall, such as several inches a day, small fish in rivers tend to concentrate in areas where they can escape
                  the excessively heavy flow. Bigger Fish tend to go on a feeding spree that may carry them upstream and downstream through their home area.

                <p>Water levels are one of the most important factors on almost all waterbodies, and knowing how the water level is relative to past trips will help you more quickly relocate fish. A key is to pick a marker, whether it be a particular bridge piling, dock post, or stump, and always remember to look at it every time you arrive to fish. If thereâ€™s nothing available, a stick stuck in the mud on shore will quickly tell you how the water level compares to your last trip.</p>

                <p>The best time to fish is before a front comes through, and right after. Depending on the species, fish go on feeding sprees either before or after a storm.</p>
